**Skill Version:** 0.03
**Reading Level:** College (Sophomore)

## Summary

Chapter 13 content has been successfully generated, covering advanced Verilog constructs for modeling digital systems at various levels of abstraction. The chapter emphasizes the critical distinction between blocking and non-blocking assignments, always blocks with different sensitivity lists, and the three main modeling styles (structural, behavioral, and RTL).

## Concepts Covered (15/15) ✓

All concepts from the learning graph have been covered:

1. ✓ **Always Block** - Core procedural construct with detailed execution model
2. ✓ **Sensitivity List** - Level-sensitive and edge-sensitive triggers, @(*) syntax
3. ✓ **Blocking Assignment** - Sequential execution with = operator
4. ✓ **Non-Blocking Assignment** - Parallel updates with <= operator, swap example
5. ✓ **If-Else in Verilog** - Priority encoding, latch prevention
6. ✓ **Case Statement** - Multi-way selection, case/casez/casex variants
7. ✓ **Combinational Always** - Rules for @(*) blocks
8. ✓ **Sequential Always** - Rules for @(posedge clk) blocks
9. ✓ **Posedge Keyword** - Rising edge detection, flip-flop inference
10. ✓ **Negedge Keyword** - Falling edge detection
11. ✓ **Structural Modeling** - Component instantiation and wiring
12. ✓ **Behavioral Modeling** - High-level abstraction, operators
13. ✓ **Gate-Level Verilog** - Built-in primitives (and, or, xor, etc.)
14. ✓ **RTL Verilog** - Register-transfer level, synthesis paradigm
15. ✓ **Hierarchical Design** - Module organization, divide and conquer

## Tone and Style

The chapter maintains a light-hearted, positive tone as specified:
- Multiple metaphors (LEGO bricks, watchful guardian, cooking recipe, synchronized dance)
- Encouraging language ("level up your Verilog game")
- Conversational style with direct reader address ("Here's the plot twist...")
- Humor interspersed ("That's some serious dedication!")

## Technical Accuracy

- Follows Verilog-2001 standard conventions
- Emphasis on @(*) for combinational logic
- Proper separation of blocking/non-blocking assignment contexts
- Correct treatment of synchronous vs asynchronous reset
- Latch inference warning with fixes

## Key Teaching Points Emphasized

1. **The Assignment Golden Rules** - Critical distinction between = and <=
2. **Latch Prevention** - Always cover all cases in combinational logic
3. **Simulation-Synthesis Match** - Use @(*) to ensure consistency
4. **RTL Paradigm** - Register-to-register flow with combinational logic between
5. **Hierarchical Thinking** - Plan architecture before coding
