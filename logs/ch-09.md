## Key Equations Used

All equations use backslash delimiters as requested:

- FSM equation: `\[S^+ = f(S, I)\]`
- Moore output: `\[Output = g(S)\]`
- Mealy output: `\[Output = h(S, I)\]`
- D flip-flop equations for various FSM designs
- Next-state equations for sequence detectors and vending machine

## Special Features

1. **Light-hearted Tone:** Includes jokes like "Let's flip into it!", board game metaphors, and engaging storytelling
2. **Real-World Examples:** Traffic lights, vending machines, video games, turnstiles
3. **Complete Design Example:** Full vending machine FSM design walkthrough
4. **Moore vs Mealy Comparison:** Detailed side-by-side analysis with practical guidance
5. **Practice Problems:** 6 problems with complete solutions covering all major topics
6. **Graphic Novel Suggestion:** Story of Moore and Mealy at Bell Labs/IBM

## Skills Required for MicroSim Implementation

To implement the 9 MicroSims, use:
- `microsim-generator` skill with p5.js for all interactive elements
- Each MicroSim specification includes complete canvas layout, interactive elements, data visibility requirements, and visual style guidance

## Notes

- Chapter follows the same format as Chapter 8 (Flip-Flops and Timing)
- Equations placed outside admonitions as requested
- Iframes placed after `#### Diagram:` headers and before `<details>` blocks as requested
- All ASCII art diagrams use box-drawing characters for clear representation
