## Tone and Style Notes

- Light-hearted and positive tone throughout
- Metaphors and analogies used extensively:
  - Architect analogy for digital design
  - "Tourist to licensed contractor" progression
  - Amnesiac friend for combinational circuits
  - Combination lock for sequential circuits
  - Vending machine price display for combinational logic
- Puns and wordplay:
  - "Digital Logic Land"
  - "The Great Divide" for combinational vs sequential
  - References to being a "licensed contractor"
- Historical reference to Maurice Karnaugh (1953)
- Practical workflow emphasized throughout
- Clear step-by-step processes

## Key Pedagogical Features

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Starts with combinational vs sequential distinction before diving into design techniques
2. **Systematic Workflow**: Emphasizes repeatable design process (specification → canonical form → simplification → gates → verification)
3. **Visual Learning**: K-maps introduced as visual alternative to algebraic methods
4. **Practical Focus**: Every concept tied to real circuit implementation
5. **Common Mistakes Section**: Explicitly addresses typical student errors

## MicroSims Implementation Notes

The new MicroSims for this chapter should:

1. **Combinational vs Sequential**: Use state tracking to show sequential behavior, no state for combinational
2. **Boolean to Gates Mapper**: Requires expression parser and gate layout algorithm
3. **K-Map MicroSims**: Need Gray code layout, wrap-around detection, and group validation
4. **Design Workflow**: Multi-stage state management with step-through capability

Key technical considerations:
- Use canvas-based controls (not DOM elements)
- Include `updateCanvasSize()` in setup for responsive design
- Leverage existing logic-gate-lib.js for gate drawing
- Implement proper Gray code ordering for K-maps
- Support don't-care (X) cells in K-maps

## Connections to Other Chapters

- **Prerequisites**: Builds on Chapter 2 (Boolean Algebra) and Chapter 3 (Logic Gates)
- **Forward References**: Sequential logic introduced as contrast, to be covered in Chapter 7
- **Shared Resources**: Can reuse logic-gate-lib.js from Chapter 3 sims

## Next Steps

1. Implement combinational vs sequential comparison MicroSim
2. Create Boolean expression to gates mapper
3. Build interactive K-map tools (2-var and 3-var)
4. Develop algebraic simplification stepper
5. Create complete design workflow demonstration
6. Consider: 4-variable K-maps for advanced students (Chapter 5 content)
