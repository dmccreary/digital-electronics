## Writing Style Notes

- Light-hearted, conversational tone as requested
- Humor elements included:
  - "computers are terrible at counting to ten"
  - "if you only had two fingers, you'd probably count differently too"
  - "where 10 + 10 = 100, and that's not a typo"
  - "chmod 755, anyone?"
  - Reference to 0xDEADBEEF as programmer humor
- Metaphors and stories used:
  - Finger counting analogy for binary
  - "Magic trick" framing for two's complement
  - "Superpower" reframe of binary's limitations
- Direct but friendly explanations suitable for college sophomores

## Skills Required for Implementation

The following skills would be needed to implement the MicroSims specified in this chapter:

1. **microsim-generator** - For creating all 8 interactive simulations
2. p5.js development knowledge for implementation

## Next Steps

1. Create MicroSim directories under `docs/sims/` for each specified simulation
2. Implement MicroSims using p5.js following the detailed specifications
3. Test iframe embedding in the chapter
4. Generate quiz questions for this chapter using `quiz-generator` skill
