## Practice Problems

7 practice problems included covering:
1. Module syntax identification
2. Wire vs Reg selection
3. Port direction declarations
4. Parameter usage
5. Continuous vs procedural assignments
6. Module instantiation
7. Number format conversion

All problems include expandable solutions using `??? question` collapsible blocks.

## Special Features

- **Graphic Novel Suggestion:** Story of Phil Moorby and the creation of Verilog
- **Common Beginner Mistakes:** Section addressing 5 frequent errors
- **Complete Design Example:** Parameterized shift register with testbench
- **Operator Reference Tables:** Comprehensive quick-reference for Verilog operators
- **Number Format Reference:** Complete syntax guide with examples

## Tone and Style

The chapter maintains a light-hearted, positive tone as specified:
- Multiple metaphors (LEGO bricks, robots, water pipes, spreadsheets, movies vs photographs)
- Encouraging language ("congratulations," "superpower")
- Conversational style with direct reader address
- Occasional wordplay ("lingua franca of chip design")

## Technical Accuracy

- Follows Verilog-2001 standard conventions
- ANSI-style port declarations emphasized as modern preference
- Clear distinction between synthesizable and simulation-only constructs
- Proper treatment of blocking vs non-blocking assignments (teased for next chapter)

## Prerequisites Referenced

- Chapter 4: Combinational Logic Design Fundamentals
- Chapter 7: Introduction to Sequential Logic
- Chapter 11: Registers, Counters, and Datapath

## Next Chapter Preview

Content naturally leads into Chapter 13 (Verilog Modeling) with mention of:
