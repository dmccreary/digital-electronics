## Skills Required for MicroSim Implementation

- **microsim-generator**: All 9 MicroSim specifications need p5.js implementation
- Estimated complexity: Medium to High (datapath visualization is complex)

## Notes

- Used backslash delimiters for equations as requested (`\[...\]` and `\(...\)`)
- Equations kept outside of admonitions as requested
- Light-hearted tone with metaphors (flip-flops as orchestra, registers as notebooks)
- Included puns ("shift into high gear", etc.)
- Added iframe elements after Diagram headers as requested
- Verilog code examples included for practical reference
- ASCII art diagrams for circuit structure visualization
- Comprehensive practice problems with hidden solutions
