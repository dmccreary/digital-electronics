## Tone and Style Notes

- Light-hearted and positive tone throughout
- Jokes and puns included (e.g., "You can't power your laptop with De Morgan's theorem", "One Gate to Rule Them All")
- Metaphors used extensively:
  - Sheet music vs instruments analogy for Boolean algebra vs gates
  - Relay runner analogy for buffer
  - Security door with two locks for AND gate
  - Automatic door with motion sensors for OR gate
  - Light switch at top/bottom of stairs for XOR
- Historical references (Apollo Guidance Computer NOR gates, 7400 NAND chip)
- Practical applications highlighted throughout

## MicroSims Implementation Notes

The existing `docs/sims/logic-gates/` MicroSim can be reused for the "All Logic Gates Gallery" diagram. The logic-gate-lib.js library provides functions for drawing all gate symbols and can be leveraged for new MicroSims.

New MicroSims should follow the established pattern:
- Use canvas-based controls (not DOM elements)
- Include `updateCanvasSize()` in setup for responsive design
- Follow color conventions from existing sims
- Implement proper hover/click interactions

## Next Steps

1. Implement individual gate MicroSims (buffer, NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR)
2. Create NAND/NOR universal gate builder sims
3. Develop timing and signal visualization sims
4. Build TTL vs CMOS comparison infographic
5. Create Boolean-to-gates workflow diagram
