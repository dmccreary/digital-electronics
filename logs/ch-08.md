**Reading Level:** Sophomore in college (undergraduate)

## Chapter Summary

This chapter covers edge-triggered flip-flops, the fundamental storage elements in synchronous digital systems. Topics include D, JK, and T flip-flops, edge-triggering mechanisms including master-slave configurations, and asynchronous preset and clear inputs. Critical timing concepts including setup time, hold time, clock-to-Q delay, timing diagrams, and timing violations are thoroughly covered. The chapter also addresses metastability, MTBF, and synchronization techniques including the double-flop synchronizer.

## Key Equations (using backslash delimiters)

- D Flip-Flop: \(Q^+ = D\)
- JK Flip-Flop: \(Q^+ = J \cdot \overline{Q} + \overline{K} \cdot Q\)
- T Flip-Flop: \(Q^+ = T \oplus Q\)
- Setup Constraint: \(t_{CQ} + t_{logic} + t_{routing} \leq T_{clock} - t_{setup}\)
- Hold Constraint: \(t_{CQ} + t_{logic} + t_{routing} \geq t_{hold}\)
- Maximum Frequency: \(f_{max} = \frac{1}{t_{CQ} + t_{logic_{max}} + t_{routing} + t_{setup}}\)
- Metastability Probability: \(P(metastable) \propto e^{-t/\tau}\)
- MTBF Formula: \(MTBF = \frac{e^{t_{resolution}/\tau}}{f_{clock} \cdot f_{async} \cdot t_w}\)
