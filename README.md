# Digital Electronics Course

This GitHub repository contains content and MicroSim for an undergraduate course in digital electronics.  Our goal is to provide resources for teaching some of the most difficult concepts in an introduction to digital electronics course by using generative AI to create lesson plans and simulations.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvements.
