#### ABET-aligned EE Curriculum

A curriculum aligned with the standards of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

A carefully scaffolded, outcomes-driven program that ensures students don’t just learn electrical engineering concepts — they learn how to think, design, build, and verify real engineering systems at a professional level.

ABET stands for Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. It is not a government agency; it is a professional accreditor recognized by industry, licensing boards, and universities.
