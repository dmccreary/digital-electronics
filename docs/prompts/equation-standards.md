I just realized that our preferred convention for writing LaTeX equations in this      
  book is to use the "\(" and "\)" notation, not "$$" and "$$" to signify the start      
  and end of a LaTeX equations.  Please do two things: 1. - fix any existing             
  equations in chapter 1 and 2 and 2. Add a note to the CLAUDE.md file that this is      
  our preferred way of adding equations.  

  I can see both chapters use $...$ for inline math and Chapter 2 also uses $$...$$ for  
  display math. I'll convert these to \(...\) for inline and \[...\] for display math,   
  then update CLAUDE.md.
