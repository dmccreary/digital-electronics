!!! prompt
    Please run the /quiz-generator tool to create quizzes for each chapter.  Place each quiz in the chapter's      
    folder in a file called quiz.md.  Update the mkdocs.yml file when done.  Use a "Content" label for the         
    chapter content (index.md) and "Quiz" label for the quiz file.
