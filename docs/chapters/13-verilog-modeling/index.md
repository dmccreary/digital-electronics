# Verilog Behavioral and Structural Modeling

## Summary

This chapter covers advanced Verilog constructs for modeling digital systems at various levels of abstraction. Students will master the always block and sensitivity lists, understand the critical difference between blocking and non-blocking assignments, use if-else and case statements for decision logic, and write combinational always blocks (with @(*)) and sequential always blocks (with @(posedge clk)). The chapter covers three modeling styles: structural modeling using gate primitives and module instantiation, behavioral modeling using procedural statements, and gate-level Verilog. RTL Verilog and hierarchical design principles complete the coverage.
