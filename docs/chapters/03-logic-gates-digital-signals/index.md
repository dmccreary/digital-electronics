# Logic Gates and Digital Signal Properties

## Summary

This chapter bridges the gap between Boolean algebra theory and physical circuit implementation by introducing logic gates as the building blocks of digital systems. Students will learn about all primitive gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR), the concept of functional completeness and universal gates, gate timing characteristics including propagation delay, fan-in and fan-out considerations, logic families (TTL and CMOS), and digital signal properties. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing real hardware that correctly implements Boolean functions.
