# FSM Design and Applications

## Summary

This chapter applies FSM theory to practical design problems, teaching students the complete workflow from specification to implementation. Students will learn to derive next-state and output equations from state tables, follow the systematic FSM design process, and verify FSM designs for correctness. The chapter includes practical applications including sequence detectors with overlapping and non-overlapping detection modes, pattern recognition FSMs, and classic controller examples such as traffic light controllers and vending machine FSMs.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Next State Equation
2. Output Equation
3. FSM Design Process
4. FSM Verification
5. Sequence Detector
6. Pattern Recognition FSM
7. Overlapping Detection
8. Non-Overlapping Detection
9. Traffic Light Controller
10. Vending Machine FSM

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:
