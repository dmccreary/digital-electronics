# Testbenches and Simulation

## Summary

This chapter covers the verification side of digital design, teaching students to validate their Verilog designs through simulation before hardware implementation. Students will learn to create testbenches, generate stimulus including clock signals and test vectors, build self-checking testbenches for automated verification, run simulations, and interpret results using waveform viewers for debugging. The chapter also covers the synthesis process, distinguishing between synthesizable and non-synthesizable code constructs, preparing students for FPGA implementation.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 12 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Testbench
2. Stimulus Generation
3. Clock Generation
4. Test Vector
5. Self-Checking Testbench
6. Simulation
7. Simulation Time
8. Waveform Viewer
9. Debugging Waveforms
10. Synthesis
11. Synthesizable Code
12. Non-Synthesizable Code

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 12: Verilog HDL Fundamentals](../12-verilog-hdl-fundamentals/index.md)
- [Chapter 13: Verilog Behavioral and Structural Modeling](../13-verilog-modeling/index.md)
