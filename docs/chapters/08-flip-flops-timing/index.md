# Flip-Flops and Timing

## Summary

This chapter covers edge-triggered flip-flops, the fundamental storage elements in synchronous digital systems. Students will learn about D, JK, and T flip-flops, understand edge-triggering mechanisms including master-slave configurations, and work with asynchronous preset and clear inputs. Critical timing concepts including setup time, hold time, clock-to-Q delay, timing diagrams, and timing violations are thoroughly covered. The chapter also addresses metastability, its causes, and synchronization techniques including the double-flop synchronizer for handling asynchronous inputs safely.
