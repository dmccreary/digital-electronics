# Combinational Building Blocks

## Summary

This chapter introduces the standard combinational circuit modules that serve as building blocks for larger digital systems. Students will design and analyze multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, priority encoders, binary and magnitude comparators, half and full adders, ripple-carry adders, and understand ALU concepts. Additional topics include parity generation and checking for error detection, tri-state buffers, and bus architecture. These modular components are fundamental to constructing complex digital systems efficiently.
