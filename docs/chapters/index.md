## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is designed with a careful progression of concepts where each chapter builds on the knowledge from previous chapters. The learning graph ensures that all prerequisite concepts are covered before they are needed. Students should work through chapters sequentially, as later chapters assume familiarity with earlier material.

---

**Note:** Each chapter includes a list of concepts covered from the learning graph. Make sure to complete prerequisites before moving to advanced chapters.
