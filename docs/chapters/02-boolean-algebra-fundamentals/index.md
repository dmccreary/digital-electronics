# Boolean Algebra Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter transforms logical reasoning into a mathematical framework that forms the theoretical foundation of all digital circuits. Students will learn about Boolean variables, constants, and the three fundamental operations (AND, OR, NOT), how to construct and interpret Boolean expressions and functions, the role of truth tables as formal specifications, and all essential Boolean algebra laws including De Morgan's theorem. Mastering these concepts enables students to analyze and simplify digital logic mathematically.
