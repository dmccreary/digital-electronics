# Logic Minimization and Karnaugh Maps

## Summary

This chapter provides advanced techniques for optimizing Boolean functions to create efficient circuit implementations. Students will master 4-variable Karnaugh maps and their grouping rules, learn to identify prime implicants and essential prime implicants, handle don't-care conditions for further optimization, derive minimal SOP and POS expressions, understand the Quine-McCluskey method for larger functions, and design hazard-free circuits. These optimization skills are critical for creating practical, cost-effective digital systems.
