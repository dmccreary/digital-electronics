# Verilog HDL Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter introduces Verilog as a hardware description language, emphasizing that HDLs describe hardware behavior rather than software execution. Students will learn the fundamental distinction between HDL and programming languages, Verilog module structure and syntax, port declarations (input, output, inout), data types including wire and reg, parameters for configurable designs, continuous assignments using the assign statement, initial blocks for simulation, and module instantiation for building hierarchical designs. These fundamentals prepare students for behavioral and structural modeling.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 14 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Verilog HDL
2. HDL vs Programming
3. Module Definition
4. Port Declaration
5. Input Port
6. Output Port
7. Inout Port
8. Wire Data Type
9. Reg Data Type
10. Parameter
11. Assign Statement
12. Continuous Assignment
13. Initial Block
14. Module Instantiation
