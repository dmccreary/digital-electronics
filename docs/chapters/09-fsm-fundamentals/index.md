# Finite State Machine Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter introduces finite state machines (FSMs), the core abstraction for designing sequential digital systems with well-defined behavior. Students will learn the FSM model including states, transitions, inputs, and outputs, understand the distinction between Moore machines (outputs depend only on state) and Mealy machines (outputs depend on state and inputs), and master state diagram and state table representations. The chapter covers state encoding strategies including binary, one-hot, and Gray code encoding, along with state assignment optimization and state minimization techniques.
