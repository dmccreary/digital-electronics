# Combinational Logic Design Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter introduces the systematic methodology for designing combinational logic circuits where outputs depend only on current inputs. Students will learn the distinction between combinational and sequential logic, how to map Boolean expressions to gate-level implementations, canonical representations including Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS), minterms and maxterms, and the foundations of logic minimization including an introduction to Karnaugh maps. These design techniques form the core workflow for creating digital circuits from specifications.
