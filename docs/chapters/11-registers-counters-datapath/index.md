# Registers, Counters, and Datapath

## Summary

This chapter covers the sequential building blocks that form the foundation of digital datapath design. Students will learn about registers including parallel load and shift registers with various configurations (SISO, SIPO, PISO, PIPO), bidirectional and universal shift registers, and control signals for enable, load, and clear operations. Counter design is thoroughly covered including up, down, and up-down counters, mod-N counters, BCD and decade counters, and specialized counters like ring and Johnson counters. The chapter concludes with datapath concepts, control units, and register transfer level (RTL) abstraction.
