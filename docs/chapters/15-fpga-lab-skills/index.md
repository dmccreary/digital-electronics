# FPGA Implementation and Laboratory Skills

## Summary

This chapter bridges theory and practice by covering FPGA implementation and hands-on laboratory skills. Students will learn FPGA architecture including look-up tables (LUTs), flip-flops, and routing resources, the FPGA implementation flow, and pin assignment. Laboratory skills include breadboard prototyping, using logic probes and logic analyzers, working with LED indicators and switch inputs, and implementing switch debouncing. The chapter covers design verification approaches including functional and timing verification, design hierarchy and reuse principles, documentation practices, and the complete digital system design workflow.
