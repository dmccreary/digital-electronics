# Introduction to Sequential Logic

## Summary

This chapter marks the conceptual leap from combinational to sequential logic, where circuits can store information and their outputs depend on both current inputs and past history. Students will learn about memory elements, the concept of state, feedback loops in circuits, bistable elements, and latches including SR and D latches. The chapter also covers level-sensitive behavior, timing problems with latches, race conditions, and introduces clock signals as the foundation for synchronous design. Understanding these concepts is essential before studying flip-flops and finite state machines.
