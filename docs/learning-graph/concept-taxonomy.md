# Digital Electronics Concept Taxonomy

This taxonomy organizes the 300 concepts into 12 categories for visualization and navigation.

## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Concepts that form the absolute foundation, typically prerequisite knowledge or standalone concepts that anchor the learning graph.

### NUMSYS - Number Systems
Binary arithmetic, number representations, conversions, and special encoding schemes like BCD and Gray code.

### BOOL - Boolean Algebra
Boolean variables, operations, expressions, functions, truth tables, and all Boolean algebra laws including De Morgan's theorem.

### GATES - Logic Gates
All primitive logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR), their symbols, properties like delay, fan-in/fan-out, and logic levels.

### COMB - Combinational Logic
Combinational circuit design methodology including SOP/POS forms, minterms, maxterms, K-maps, and logic minimization.

### BLOCKS - Building Blocks
Standard combinational building blocks: multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, comparators, adders, and ALU concepts.

### SEQ - Sequential Basics
Introduction to sequential logic: memory elements, state concept, feedback, latches (SR, D), and clock signals.

### FLIPFLOP - Flip-Flops
Edge-triggered flip-flops (D, JK, T), timing parameters (setup, hold, clock-to-Q), metastability, and synchronization.

### FSM - Finite State Machines
Moore and Mealy machines, state diagrams, state tables, encoding methods, design process, and FSM applications.

### REG - Registers & Counters
Registers, shift registers, counters (up/down, ring, Johnson), datapath concepts, and register transfer level.

### HDL - Verilog HDL
Verilog language constructs: modules, ports, data types, assignments, always blocks, modeling styles, and hierarchy.

### VERIFY - Verification & Lab
Testbenches, simulation, waveforms, synthesis, FPGA implementation, and laboratory/prototyping skills.
