# Digital Electronics

![](./img/cover.png)

Welcome to the digital electronics course website!

Our goal is to provide resources for teaching some of the most difficult concepts in an introduction to digital electronics course by using generative AI to create lesson plans and simulations.

To use this site you can use the search function in the upper right corner or use the navigation system on the left side of the pages.

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvements.

Have fun!
